# Welcome!

<br>

test
This is the lab manual for the for the paleoclimate Group at Northern Arizona University.

Altogether, we do a lot of work across the field of paleoclimatology, but have particular expertise in the late Quaternary (especially Holocene), and have emphases in high-latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) paleoclimate, paleolimnology, paleoclimate informatics, multiproxy data synthesis and data-model intercomparison. 

This lab manual resource is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Nick (nick@nau.edu) or make a pull request.

This book was inspired by [The Fay Lab's manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/), and we drew heavily on their manual as we developed ours.
